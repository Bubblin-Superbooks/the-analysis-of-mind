<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>The consideration of negative propositions and negative facts introduces further complications. An image-proposition is necessarily positive: we can image the window to the left of the door, or to the right of the door, but we can form no image of the bare negative "the window not to the left of the door." We can DISBELIEVE the image-proposition expressed by "the window to the left of the door," and our disbelief will be true if the window is not to the left of the door. But we can form no image of the fact that the window is not to the left of the door. Attempts have often been made to deny such negative facts, but, for reasons which I have given elsewhere, I believe these attempts to be mistaken, and I shall assume that there are negative facts.</p><blockquote class="  "><pre><code>"Monist," January, 1919, p. 42 ff.</code></pre>
