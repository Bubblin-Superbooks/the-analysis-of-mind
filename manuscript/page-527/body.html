<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Iii. Many Difficult Problems Arise As Regards The Verifiability Of Beliefs. We Believe Various Things, And While We Believe Them We Think We Know Them. But It Sometimes Turns Out That We Were Mistaken, Or At Any Rate We Come To Think We Were. We Must Be Mistaken Either In Our Previous Opinion Or In Our Subsequent Recantation; Therefore Our Beliefs Are Not All Correct, And There Are Cases Of Belief Which Are Not Cases Of Knowledge. The Question Of Verifiability Is In Essence This: Can We Discover Any Set Of Beliefs Which Are Never Mistaken Or Any Test Which, When Applicable, Will Always Enable Us To Discriminate Between True And False Beliefs? Put Thus Broadly And Abstractly, The Answer Must Be Negative. There Is No Way Hitherto Discovered Of Wholly Eliminating The Risk Of Error, And No Infallible Criterion. If We Believe We Have Found A Criterion, This Belief Itself May Be Mistaken; We Should Be Begging The Question If We Tried To Test The Criterion By Applying The Criterion To Itself.</h4></div> </div>
