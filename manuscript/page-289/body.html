All that we really mean by calling an image "unreal" is that it does not have the concomitants which it would have if it were a sensation. When we call up a visual image of a chair, we do not attempt to sit in it, because we know that, like Macbeth's dagger, it is not "sensible to feeling as to sight"â€”i.e. it does not have the correlations with tactile sensations which it would have if it were a visual sensation and not merely a visual image.
