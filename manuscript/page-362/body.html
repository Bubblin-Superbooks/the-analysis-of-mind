<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">the specific kind of belief-feeling that is characteristic of memory, seems to be what constitutes the act of remembering in its pure form.</p><p>We may now summarize our analysis of pure memory.</p><p>Memory demands (a) an image, (b) a belief in past existence. The belief may be expressed in the words "this existed."</p><p>The belief, like every other, may be analysed into (1) the believing, (2) what is believed. The believing is a specific feeling or sensation or complex of sensations, different from expectation or bare assent in a way that makes the belief refer to the past; the reference to the past lies in the belief-feeling, not in the content believed. There is a relation between the belief-feeling and the content, making the belief-feeling refer to the content, and expressed by saying that the content is what is believed.</p></div> </div>
