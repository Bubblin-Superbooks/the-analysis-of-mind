If We Observe These Responses From Outside, We Shall Regard Them As Showing Knowledge When They Display Two Characteristics, Accuracy And Appropriateness. These Two Are Quite Distinct, And Even Sometimes Incompatible. If I Am Being Pursued By A Tiger, Accuracy Is Furthered By Turning Round To Look At Him, But Appropriateness By Running Away Without Making Any Search For Further Knowledge Of The Beast. I Shall Return To The Question Of Appropriateness Later; For The Present It Is Accuracy That I Wish To Consider.</h4></div> </div>
