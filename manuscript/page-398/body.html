<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Having admitted images, we may say that the word "box," in the absence of the box, is caused by an image of the box. This may or may not be trueâ€”in fact, it is true in some cases but not in others. Even, however, if it were true in all cases, it would only slightly shift our problem: we should now have to ask what causes an image of the box to arise. We might be inclined to say that desire for the box is the cause. But when this view is investigated, it is found that it compels us to suppose that the box can be desired without the child's having either an image of the box or the word "box." This will require a theory of desire which may be, and I think is, in the main true, but which removes desire from among things that actually occur, and makes it merely a convenient fiction, like force in mechanics. With such a view, desire is no longer a true cause, but merely a short way of describing certain processes.</p></div> </div>
