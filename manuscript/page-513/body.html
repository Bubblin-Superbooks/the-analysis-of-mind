<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Ii. I Have So Far Assumed As Unquestionable The View That The Truth Or Falsehood Of A Belief Consists In A Relation To A Certain Fact, Namely The Objective Of The Belief. This View Has, However, Been Often Questioned. Philosophers Have Sought Some Intrinsic Criterion By Which True And False Beliefs Could Be Distinguished. I Am Afraid Their Chief Reason For This Search Has Been The Wish To Feel More Certainty Than Seems Otherwise Possible As To What Is True And What Is False. If We Could Discover The Truth Of A Belief By Examining Its Intrinsic Characteristics, Or Those Of Some Collection Of Beliefs Of Which It Forms Part, The Pursuit Of Truth, It Is Thought, Would Be A Less Arduous Business Than It Otherwise Appears To Be. But The Attempts Which Have Been Made In This Direction Are Not Encouraging. I Will Take Two Criteria Which Have Been Suggested, Namely, (1) Self-evidence, (2) Mutual Coherence. If We Can Show That These Are Inadequate, We May Feel Fairly Certain That No Intrinsic Criterion Hitherto Suggested Will Suffice To Distinguish True From False Beliefs.</h4></div> </div>
