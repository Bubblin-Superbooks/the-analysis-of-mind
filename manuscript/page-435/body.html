A good summary of such work up to the year agog is contained in Titchener's "Lectures on the Experimental Psychology of the Thought Processes" (1909). Three articles in the "Archiv fur die gesammte Psychologie" by Watt, Messer and Buhler contain a great deal of the material amassed by the methods which Titchener calls experimental.</p><blockquote class="  "><pre><code>Henry J.
