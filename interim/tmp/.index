This Response Must Have Some Characteristics Which It Shares With Those Of Scientific Instruments, But Must Also Have Others That Are Peculiar To Knowledge.

This Raises The Problem Of Verifiability: Are There Any Circumstances Which Can Justifiably Give Us An Unusual Degree Of Certainty That Such And Such A Belief Is True?

If We Observe These Responses From Outside, We Shall Regard Them As Showing Knowledge When They Display Two Characteristics, Accuracy And Appropriateness. These Two Are Quite Distinct, And Even Sometimes Incompatible. If I Am Being Pursued By A Tiger, Accuracy Is Furthered By Turning Round To Look At Him, But Appropriateness By Running Away Without Making Any Search For Further Knowledge Of The Beast. I Shall Return To The Question Of Appropriateness Later; For The Present It Is Accuracy That I Wish To Consider.</a> <span class=\"flex\">500</span> </li>",
  "22": "<li><a class = \"page\" href=\"513\">Ii. I Have So Far Assumed As Unquestionable The View That The Truth Or Falsehood Of A Belief Consists In A Relation To A Certain Fact, Namely The Objective Of The Belief. This View Has, However, Been Often Questioned. Philosophers Have Sought Some Intrinsic Criterion By Which True And False Beliefs Could Be Distinguished. I Am Afraid Their Chief Reason For This Search Has Been The Wish To Feel More Certainty Than Seems Otherwise Possible As To What Is True And What Is False. If We Could Discover The Truth Of A Belief By Examining Its Intrinsic Characteristics, Or Those Of Some Collection Of Beliefs Of Which It Forms Part, The Pursuit Of Truth, It Is Thought, Would Be A Less Arduous Business Than It Otherwise Appears To Be. But The Attempts Which Have Been Made In This Direction Are Not Encouraging. I Will Take Two Criteria Which Have Been Suggested, Namely, (1) Self-evidence, (2) Mutual Coherence. If We Can Show That These Are Inadequate, We May Feel Fairly Certain That No Intrinsic Criterion Hitherto Suggested Will Suffice To Distinguish True From False Beliefs.</a> <span class=\"flex\">513</span> </li>",
  "23": "<li><a class = \"page\" href=\"527\">Iii. Many Difficult Problems Arise As Regards The Verifiability Of Beliefs. We Believe Various Things, And While We Believe Them We Think We Know Them. But It Sometimes Turns Out That We Were Mistaken, Or At Any Rate We Come To Think We Were. We Must Be Mistaken Either In Our Previous Opinion Or In Our Subsequent Recantation; Therefore Our Beliefs Are Not All Correct, And There Are Cases Of Belief Which Are Not Cases Of Knowledge. The Question Of Verifiability Is In Essence This: Can We Discover Any Set Of Beliefs Which Are Never Mistaken Or Any Test Which, When Applicable, Will Always Enable Us To Discriminate Between True And False Beliefs? Put Thus Broadly And Abstractly, The Answer Must Be Negative. There Is No Way Hitherto Discovered Of Wholly Eliminating The Risk Of Error, And No Infallible Criterion. If We Believe We Have Found A Criterion, This Belief Itself May Be Mistaken; We Should Be Begging The Question If We Tried To Test The Criterion By Applying The Criterion To Itself.</a> <span class=\"flex\">527</span> </li>",
